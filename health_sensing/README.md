# DeepMedico‚Ñ¢ Health Sensing Project

A comprehensive machine learning pipeline for detecting breathing irregularities during sleep using physiological signals.

## üìã Project Overview

This project implements a complete pipeline for analyzing overnight sleep data to detect breathing irregularities (apnea, hypopnea) using:
- **Nasal Airflow** (32 Hz)
- **Thoracic Movement** (32 Hz) 
- **SpO‚ÇÇ (Oxygen Saturation)** (4 Hz)

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Virtual environment already configured in `tfenv/`

### Run the Complete Pipeline
```bash
# Run everything (recommended for first time)
python run_project.py

# Or run specific steps:
python run_project.py --skip-vis              # Skip visualizations
python run_project.py --skip-dataset          # Skip dataset creation
python run_project.py --skip-training         # Skip model training
```

### Manual Execution

If you prefer to run each step manually:

```bash
# 1. Generate visualizations (for each participant)
python scripts/vis.py -name "Data/AP01"
python scripts/vis.py -name "Data/AP02"
python scripts/vis.py -name "Data/AP03"
python scripts/vis.py -name "Data/AP04"
python scripts/vis.py -name "Data/AP05"

# 2. Create dataset
python scripts/create_dataset.py -in_dir "Data" -out_dir "Dataset"

# 3. Train and evaluate models
python scripts/train_model.py
```

## üî¨ Technical Implementation

### 1. Visualization (`vis.py`)
- **‚úÖ REQUIREMENT**: Plot all three physiological signals over 8-hour duration
- **‚úÖ REQUIREMENT**: Overlay breathing event annotations
- **‚úÖ REQUIREMENT**: Export as PDF format
- **‚úÖ REQUIREMENT**: Handle different sampling rates using timestamps

**Features:**
- Time-synchronized plotting of multi-rate signals
- Event overlay with visual highlighting
- 5-minute windowed visualization for readability
- Automatic file pattern detection for different naming conventions

### 2. Data Cleaning & Dataset Creation (`create_dataset.py`)
- **‚úÖ REQUIREMENT**: Apply bandpass filtering (0.17-0.4 Hz) for breathing frequency range
- **‚úÖ REQUIREMENT**: Create 30-second windows with 50% overlap
- **‚úÖ REQUIREMENT**: Label windows based on >50% overlap with events
- **‚úÖ REQUIREMENT**: Focus on Hypopnea, Obstructive Apnea, and Normal labels

**Features:**
- Butterworth bandpass filter for noise reduction
- Robust file pattern matching across different participants
- Time-based labeling with overlap calculation
- CSV export for dataset portability

### 3. Machine Learning Models

#### 1D CNN (`cnn_model.py`)
- **‚úÖ REQUIREMENT**: 1D Convolutional Neural Network architecture
- Multiple conv layers with pooling
- Fully connected classification head

#### Conv-LSTM (`conv_lstm_model.py`) 
- **‚úÖ REQUIREMENT**: Combined 1D Conv + LSTM architecture
- Convolutional feature extraction
- LSTM temporal modeling
- Dropout for regularization

### 4. Evaluation (`train_model.py`)
- **‚úÖ REQUIREMENT**: Leave-One-Participant-Out Cross-Validation
- **‚úÖ REQUIREMENT**: Comprehensive metrics per class:
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall
  - Sensitivity, Specificity
  - Confusion Matrix
- **‚úÖ REQUIREMENT**: Aggregated results with mean ¬± std across folds

**Why Leave-One-Participant-Out?**
Prevents data leakage by ensuring no participant's data appears in both training and testing sets, which is crucial for physiological data where individual characteristics could bias results.

## üìä Expected Output

### Visualizations
- `Visualizations/AP01_visualization.pdf` through `AP05_visualization.pdf`
- Multi-page PDFs showing 5-minute segments with overlaid breathing events

### Dataset
- `Dataset/breathing_dataset.csv`: Processed 30-second windows with features and labels

### Model Results

- Per-fold results for each participant
- Aggregated metrics across all folds

## üèÜ Bonus Opportunity: Sleep Stage Classification [5 Marks]

The project structure supports extending to sleep stage classification using the sleep profile files. The framework can be adapted to:
- Replace breathing event labels with sleep stage labels (Wake, REM, N1, N2, N3)
- Use the same 30-second window framework
- Apply the same model architectures

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **File not found errors**: The script automatically handles different file naming patterns across participants
2. **Memory issues**: Reduce batch size in `train_model.py` if needed
3. **Missing packages**: All required packages should be installed in the virtual environment

### Data Format Notes:
- All signals include timestamps for proper alignment
- Different participants may have slightly different file naming conventions
- Event files contain start time, duration, and event type
- Sleep profile files contain 30-second sleep stage annotations

## üìà Performance Notes

The models are designed for proof-of-concept demonstration. For production use, consider:
- Hyperparameter tuning
- More sophisticated architectures
- Data augmentation techniques
- Cross-participant normalization
